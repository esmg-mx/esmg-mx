# About me 

Currently, I am a visiting scholar in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wyoming. I obtained my doctorate degree in Applied Geostatistics in the Graduate Program in Earth Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico. The title of my doctoral thesis is ”Copula-based modeling for petrophysical property prediction using seismic attributes as secondary variables”. My main research interest is developing copula-based linear and nonlinear dependency relationship models for spatial stochastic simulations of natural phenomena in Earth Sciences. 

Firstly, my professional qualification has been considerably acquired by studying around the world. In particular, I was the highest grade freshman in the Faculty of Geology at Hanoi University of Geology and Mining, and I won the bronze medal at the National Student Mathematics Olympiad in Vietnam. I obtained a Bachelor degree with distinction as the most outstanding foreign student of the University in Cuba. I obtained my doctorate degree with the Honorable Mention in Mexico. Currently, I am a visiting scholar in USA and collaborating with Dr. Dario Grana in conducting research on Bayesian and geostatistical inversion. I have also enrolled in a wide range of courses and conferences in Statistics, Geophysics, Geology, Geosciences and Earth Sciences in Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico, and USA.

I have more than 5-years of pertinent experience conducting research in Applied Geostatistics in Earth Sciences. For example, since 2016 I have been working as an assistant to my tutor in his research projects at the Mexican Institute of Petroleum, Mexico. On the other hand, I was doing PhD projects which focus on the application of the copula-based dependency pattern recognition models for petrophysical property prediction using elastic seismic attributes as secondary variables.

Main Research Interests:
- Geostatistical (spatial stochastic) simulation based on copulas and global optimization methods (simulated annealing, differential evolution).
- Integration methodology of different quantitative and qualitative information based on advanced geostatistical methods for reservoir characterization.
- Inverse theory and optimization: Bayesian and geostatistical inversion.
- Machine learning with a deep understanding of geostatistical analysis.
- Petrophysical seismic inversion based on advanced geostatistical methods and quantification of uncertainty.
- Rock physics.
